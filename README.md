# Module 9A - My First React Component

## Description
This is a React app made using Vite. It shows a UserProfile and a ContactCard. The app uses inline CSS and hover effects to make things look more interesting. I added a glowing border and a phrase that represents me.

## About Me
My name is Baptiste Williams. I’m a former Navy servicemember and arena football player. I live in Los Angeles and go to Santa Monica College, working toward a cybersecurity certification. I’m learning web development and built this project to show what I’ve learned.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React app with Vite
- How to write components in JSX
- How to add props to pass data
- How to style elements using inline CSS
- How to use hover effects and box shadows

## Challenges
I had some trouble getting the image to show correctly. I fixed it by saving the image locally and importing it into my component. I also had some syntax errors with JSX styles that I learned how to fix.

## Extra Features
- The card glows when you hover over it
- The profile image grows when you hover
- The phrase "Get in where you fit in!" is styled to stand out
